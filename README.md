# Problem Statement
In the landscape of precision agriculture, the problem lies in the development of a robust computer vision system that could seamlessly and effectively classify images or objects in the agricultural area. The traditional state of computer vision in the detection of crop diseases and pests requires more improvement and innovations. Traditional computer vision in crop disease and pest detection usually incorporates conventional image processing algorithms and manual feature engineering, together with classifiers (Sinha & Shekhawat, 2020). This approach usually involves scheme designs that are built on the specific properties of the crop. In real situations, various factors such as minor differences in the backgrounds, lesions and noises in the crop images could potentially cause inaccuracies in the method (Liu et. al., 2017; Sinha & Shekhawat, 2020). Fortunately, the advancement of deep learning has provided a promising solution. However, even with deep learning as the approach, there are also hurdles in the application. The development of deep learning models from scratch presents challenges such as data scarcity and limited computational resources. The scarcity of labelled datasets for the agricultural industry further increases the difficulty level as data scarcity will affect the generalisation of models. Thus, alternative approaches such as transfer learning that employs pre-trained models can be explored in this domain to develop deep learning-based image classifiers to detect grape leaf diseases. This is because pre-trained models are usually trained on large-scale datasets and reusing the knowledge of pre-trained models could reduce the requirements.
